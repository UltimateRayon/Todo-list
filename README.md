To-Do List for upcoming days



Current progress: 
1. Initial file upload
2. learned the basics of merging (but faced some errors at first which i needed help from internet to solve)
3. Successfully created github repo and uploaded local repo (but for some reason, there seems to be 2 files instead of 1, but later removed with .gitignore)
4. left with more queries than I originally started with.

Upcoming Target:
1. Learn more about git and github (perhaps find some answers to my queries)
2. memorize the basic commands of git
3. may refine the project
